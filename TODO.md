# Northstar — TODO

Full backlog after a complete code read (2026-06-12). Priority order is fixed:
**Navigation → Power efficiency → Maps↔Northstar↔Dash integration → correctness →
persistence/sync → secondary features → Garage (last).** Garage is intentionally
the lowest priority.

Legend: `[P0]` do first · `[P1]` … · `[P5]` last. Checkboxes track completion.

---

## P0 — NAVIGATION (primary purpose) — IMPLEMENTED, needs on-bike verification

Built a full routing + nav engine: `dash/nav/{GeoPoint,PolylineCodec,Route,Router,
NavEngine}`. Router uses the public OSRM demo server (fetched at planning time while
online, cached for offline riding). NavEngine snaps GPS to the route and computes
distance-to-turn, remaining, ETA, off-route.

- [x] **Real routing engine (road-following route).** `Router` → OSRM driving route,
  decoded polyline drawn by `MapRenderer` (route polyline + casing), not a straight line.
- [x] **Turn-by-turn instructions to the dash.** `DashCommands.activeNavPacket`
  (ported from better-dash) sent at 1 Hz via `DashSession.launchNavInfo`; fed by
  `NavEngine` maneuver + distance.
- [x] **Real distance + ETA.** `NavEngine` road distance + speed-based ETA; surfaced
  in RouteScreen (real km / duration / ETA) and the DashScreen info strip + next-turn banner.
- [x] **Heading-up map option.** `MapRenderer` rotates to GPS bearing; toggle in DashScreen.
- [x] **Pan/zoom follow vs manual mode.** `DashViewModel` manual-pan switches off
  follow, auto-recenters after 8 s idle; recenter button + joystick recenter.
- [x] **GPS robustness.** `LocationTracker` GPS + NETWORK providers, prefers GPS,
  "waiting for GPS" standby frame instead of 0,0.
- [x] **Joystick code→direction mapping verified on bike (fw 11.63).** UP=0x06,
  DOWN=0x07, LEFT=0x0A, RIGHT=0x09, IN=0x18, BACK=0x12. Mapped: RIGHT=zoom in,
  LEFT=zoom out. No exit gesture (media section is for media).
- [ ] **Joystick zoom WITHOUT entering media mode.** The dash only forwards the
  joystick (09 00) to the phone while in media-control mode; in the plain
  projected-map view it keeps the joystick for its own menus. The the dash
  apparently gets map control in nav view — capture the dash's session
  with logging (user offered to do all regular actions while capturing)
  and find the packet/flag that enables joystick forwarding during projection.
- [ ] **VERIFY ON BIKE: maneuver glyph codes.** Only CONTINUE (0x0B) is confirmed;
  `Maneuver.dashCode` returns 0x0B for all turns. Capture the dash's other glyph
  bytes and map turn-left/right/etc. (distances are already correct).

## P0 — POWER EFFICIENCY / THERMALS — IMPLEMENTED, needs ride measurement

- [x] **Frame cache; redraw only on change.** `DashViewModel.tick` builds a frame
  signature; identical frames blit the cached bitmap instead of re-rendering
  (handles stationary automatically). Forced refresh every 2 s.
- [x] **Pre-filter tiles once.** `TileProvider.darken` applies invert+desaturate+dim
  at load and caches the dark bitmap; `MapRenderer` draws plain (no per-frame ColorMatrix).
- [x] **Explicit hardware AVC encoder.** `DashEncoder.selectHardwareEncoder` picks a
  hardware-accelerated, non-software encoder; logs the chosen codec.
- [x] **No per-frame allocations.** `MapRenderer` reuses `Path`/`RectF`/`Rect`/`Paint`.
- [x] **WiFi lock tuned.** Switched `LOW_LATENCY` → `HIGH_PERF` (keeps link up at
  lower power); wake + wifi locks released in `onDestroy`.
- [x] **Thermal back-off hook.** `DashViewModel.updateThermal` reads
  `PowerManager.currentThermalStatus`, surfaces OK/Warm/Hot chip on DashScreen.
- [x] **Bounded, cache-first tile network.** `TileProvider` rate-limits fetches
  (min gap) and is fully cache-first; route prefetch along the polyline.
- [ ] **MEASURE ON RIDE.** Capture `dumpsys batterystats` + sustained temperature
  during a real screen-off ride; tune fps/bitrate back-off thresholds. Record here.

## P1a — MAP LOOK = GOOGLE MAPS (hybrid) — IMPLEMENTED, needs your API key

Decision: real Google Maps in the phone app (free native SDK), power-efficient
Google-Maps-styled map streamed to the dash.

- [x] **In-app Dash view = real Google Maps.** Replaced the decorative `CircularDash`
  (which drew a fake random polyline) with `NorthstarMap` (maps-compose `GoogleMap`)
  clipped to the round Tripper shape: blue location dot, follows current location,
  default Google view when no destination, route polyline + marker when navigating.
- [x] **Streamed dash restyled to Google-Maps look.** `TileProvider` no longer
  inverts tiles to dark — uses standard light map tiles (also the cheapest path);
  `MapRenderer` background + standby text adjusted for the light look.
- [ ] **ADD YOUR MAPS API KEY** to `local.properties` → `MAPS_API_KEY=AIza…`.
  In Google Cloud (same project as Firebase): enable **Maps SDK for Android**,
  create an API key, restrict to package `com.northstar.app` + SHA-1
  `80:30:BD:71:…:2D:C8`. Native map display is free/unlimited (billing must be
  enabled on the project but the map view itself is never charged). Until the key
  is set, the in-app map shows blank/gray.
- [ ] Optional: give the streamed dash a night style (dark map) as a P4 setting —
  light is the Google-Maps default; dark is friendlier at night / on OLED.

## P1 — GOOGLE MAPS ↔ NORTHSTAR ↔ DASH — IMPLEMENTED, needs on-device validation

- [x] **Destination → routing → dash.** `setDestination` fetches the OSRM route,
  prefetches tiles along the polyline, and feeds NavEngine + the dash nav-info loop.
- [x] **Prefetch along the real route.** `TileProvider.prefetchRoute` walks the
  polyline (not just a corridor) so offline riding has coverage the whole way.
- [x] **Route preview reflects reality.** `RouteScreen` draws the real OSRM polyline
  (bounding-box projection) and shows real distance / duration / ETA; "Send to Dash"
  carries the routed destination.
- [ ] **VALIDATE share formats on-device.** `LocationParser` handles `@lat,lng`,
  `?q=`, `?ll=`, `/place/`, and `maps.app.goo.gl` expansion — test each real share
  type from the Maps app (pins, businesses, dropped pins, `geo:`, plus-codes) and
  fix any gaps. This is the last unproven link in the chain.

### P1b — DASH → APP TELEMETRY SYNC — ⏸ LIKELY DEAD (code KEPT, confirm after root)

Evidence so far (live capture, fw 11.63): the dash sends only plaintext type-0x0C
fields that stay **all-zero even with the ignition on** (screen showed ODO 324/413 km
but forwarded nothing), and zero 0x0F packets — i.e. it does NOT appear to forward
instrument data to a projection client. BUT: per the rider, **keep the telemetry
decode/logging alive** (`DashSession` 0F AES-decrypt + 0C raw logging stay in) so we can
**definitively confirm dead-or-alive against the official-app capture once the phone is
rooted**. Do not delete this path until that capture is done.

- [~] **Decode the dash's telemetry segments.** Confirmed vs better-dash: the bike's
  instrument data arrives as **type-0F segments, AES-256-CBC encrypted** under the
  session key (better-dash only logs them as ciphertext; `decode_ic_to_app_segments`
  is just a generic slicer — it never decrypts). DONE: `DashSession.dispatchIncoming`
  now AES-decrypts 0F (IV = first 16 B) with `DashAuth.sessionKey` and logs the
  PLAINTEXT ("DASH TELEMETRY 0F … dec=…"). Since 0F rides our own session, plain
  `adb logcat -s DashSession` over USB captures it — **over the app's own session**.
  REMAINING: connect to the bike, read the dash's own trip/odo/fuel/temp values off
  its screen, correlate against the logged plaintext bytes to map the fields, then
  build the typed struct. (If `dec=` shows garbage, the 0F payload framing differs —
  the raw `enc=` is logged too, so we can adjust the IV/offset.)
- [ ] **Expose a live `BikeTelemetry` state** (trip A/B, odometer, speed, fuel,
  temps, etc.) from `DashSession` → `DashViewModel`, shown on Home/Dash and usable
  by the ride recorder and fuel/maintenance auto-fill.
- [ ] **Persist + sync the dash data** (depends on P3 DB/Firestore) so trip and
  odometer history are kept and restored across devices — keeps app ⇄ dash in sync.
- [ ] **Use real odometer for maintenance intervals** (P5 Garage) instead of the
  hardcoded "14,280 km" once telemetry is flowing.

## P2 — CONNECTION STATE & CORRECTNESS

- [x] **Unify connection status (Home says "Connected", Dash says "not").**
  `AppNavigation` now derives `conn` from the real `DashViewModel.ui.stage`
  (STREAMING→Connected, WIFI/AUTH→Searching, else Offline) for Home + Settings,
  instead of `AppViewModel.conn`'s hardcoded `Connected`.
- [x] **Home screen live data.** The fake stat tiles ("GPS Strong / 74% / 2.4 GHz")
  are gone; the hero shows the real `conn` state (Connected/Searching/Offline) + a
  "Himalayan 450" chip. No hardcoded telemetry remains.
- [x] **Bottom nav: selected icon sits lower than the rest.** Fixed — icon slot is
  now a fixed 29 dp height with the icon top-aligned and the dot bottom-aligned.
- [x] **Recent destinations are hardcoded** (Chitkul, Jalori) — removed; Home now
  lists real **saved destinations** from `RouteViewModel.saved` (tap → load + route).

## P3 — PERSISTENCE & SYNC (foundation; CLAUDE.md promises this, none exists)

There is currently **no database and no sync** — every list is static mock data and
the action buttons are no-ops. CLAUDE.md specifies SQLite source-of-truth + Firebase.

- [x] **Local persistence (SQLite).** `data/NorthstarDb` (hand-rolled
  `SQLiteOpenHelper`, no Room/KSP — avoids version risk on this Kotlin 2.2.10/AGP 9
  toolchain). Tables: `fuel_fillup`, `maintenance_item`, `bike_state` (odometer).
  Still TODO: ride history + recent destinations tables.
- [ ] **Firebase sync (Firestore) on top of local DB** so a second device restores
  data. Auth already works (Google) — key data by uid.
- [x] **Garage action buttons are real.** "Mark done today", "Log a service",
  "Add interval", "Add fill-up", "Set odometer" all persist via `GarageViewModel`.
  (RouteScreen "Remind" / TTS still pending under P4.)

## P4 — SECONDARY RIDE FEATURES

- [x] **Ride recording.** A connect→disconnect dash session = one ride. `RideRecorder`
  accumulates the GPS track (thinned to ~8 m) into distance / duration / avg+max speed +
  an encoded track polyline; saved via `SyncRepository` (local + Firestore `rides/`) on
  disconnect (trivial sessions discarded). `RidesScreen` shows totals + per-ride cards
  with a track sketch, stats, and delete; `RidesViewModel` reloads on sync. DB v4.
- [x] **TTS / voice overlay (off / chime / full).** `dash/nav/VoiceManager` (singleton,
  persisted mode) wired to the RouteScreen toggle + the nav loop. FULL speaks turns
  ("In 200 meters, turn left") via `TextToSpeech`; CHIME beeps before each turn
  (`ToneGenerator`); OFF silent. De-duped per maneuver (far ~450 m + near ~60 m) + arrival.
  Note: spoken turn TYPE depends on the unverified glyph→type map; distances are correct.
- [x] **Glanceable ETA on the dash map.** `MapRenderer` draws an upright ETA pill at the
  bottom-centre safe zone (round-display-aware), big "24 min" + "18 km · 13:32" below,
  shown only while navigating to a destination. Fed from the live nav figures.
- [→] **Media controls overlay → DEFERRED to post-root.** The dash has its OWN separate
  media/phone section; how it talks to the phone is unknown until we capture it on the
  rooted phone. Decide the design (and whether to overlay vs use the dash's section) AFTER
  the root capture. Moved out of Part A. (Android also blocks programmatic call answer/end.)

## P5 — GARAGE (LOWEST PRIORITY, do last)

- [x] **Maintenance log** — DB-backed `MaintenanceTab`: seeded intervals, "most
  urgent" hero, per-item due/overdue from the real odometer, mark-done + add/delete
  interval. **Reminders done**: `MaintenanceNotifier` posts a notification when an item
  crosses into "due" (within 25% of interval), de-duped, checked on app open + after any
  odometer/service edit.
- [x] **Fuel diary** — DB-backed `FuelTab`: add/delete fill-ups, computed per-fill
  km/l (odometer-gap), 30-day avg efficiency + spend + litres, bar chart from real
  data. **Firestore sync done** (`SyncRepository`).

---

## Distribution (decided 2026-06-14: ship to other Himalayan riders, free for the author)

Direction: **open-source + bring-your-own-keys**, with genuinely-free defaults so a
rider needs zero paid setup. The author never pays regardless of how many install it.

- [x] **Multi-SSID / multi-dash.** No more hardcoded `RE_P0RP_260525`. `DashConfig`
  (per-rider, persisted) + prefix discovery: first connect matches any `RE_*` dash
  (`WifiNetworkSpecifier.setSsidPattern(PREFIX)`), then learns + remembers that rider's
  exact SSID. Password defaults to factory `12345678`; all overridable.
- [ ] **Settings UI for the dash WiFi** (view/edit SSID + password, "Forget dash" to
  re-discover). Backing VM methods exist (`setSsid/setWifiPassword/forgetDash`).
- [~] **MapLibre + OSM migration.** Decided: **OpenFreeMap** (keyless vector, look-first;
  Liberty style), offline region download as a LATER add-on.
  - [x] **In-app map → MapLibre + OpenFreeMap.** `NorthstarMap` rewritten on `MapView`
    (route line via LineManager, dest/rider symbols via SymbolManager, follow/nav/fit-route
    cameras). **Google Maps SDK fully removed** — dropped `maps-compose` +
    `play-services-maps`, the `MAPS_API_KEY` manifest meta-data + build wiring. No Maps key
    needed anymore. (APK grew ~26→70 MB from MapLibre native .so; trim later via ABI splits.)
  - [ ] **Streamed dash basemap → keyless.** `TileProvider` still pulls the *unofficial
    Google* raster tiles (not redistributable). The dash uses the power-tuned Canvas→H.264
    pipeline; moving it to OpenFreeMap means rendering vector via MapLibre (MapSnapshotter or
    offscreen GL) with change-detection caching to protect thermals. The power-sensitive part.
  - [ ] **Routing off the OSRM demo server.** `Router` uses `router.project-osrm.org` (no
    SLA, rate-limited). Move to a free/self-hosted routing source for distribution.
- [x] **Firebase optional / bring-your-own.** The Google Services plugin is applied only
  when `app/google-services.json` exists (verified: build succeeds without it). `FirebaseGate`
  gates all access; `SyncRepository` fs/auth are null when unconfigured (everything no-ops →
  fully local). `AuthViewModel` is crash-safe + exposes `syncAvailable`. LoginScreen offers
  "Continue without signing in" (always) and hides Google sign-in when unconfigured; Settings
  shows local-only / not-signed-in / synced. A rider who omits the json runs 100% local.

## Distribution / updates (2026-06-14) — sustainable update delivery

The first public APK got Reddit traction; updates must reach people, not get lost.

- [x] **Stable release signing.** Promoted the original debug keystore (the key the first
  public APK shipped with, SHA-1 `80:30:BD:71:…:2D:C8`) to a durable release key, backed up
  at `~/keystores/northstar-release.jks`. Wired via gitignored `signing.properties` →
  `app/build.gradle.kts` release `signingConfig` (falls back to debug if the file is absent,
  so contributors can still build). **Every release shares one signature → updates install in
  place, no data loss.** Guard this key; losing it forces all users to uninstall+reinstall.
- [x] **Versioning discipline.** Bump `versionCode` every release (now 2, name 1.1).
  Updaters key off `versionCode` to detect "newer".
- [x] **Obtainium path.** README documents adding the repo to Obtainium for auto-update
  notifications (zero backend) — the recommended way riders stay current.
- [ ] **Release process (per update):** bump version → `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease` →
  `gh release create vX.Y dist/northstar-X.Y.apk --notes-file dist/RELEASE-X.Y.md`.
- [x] **In-app updater ("OTA feel").** `data/UpdateChecker` GETs
  `api.github.com/repos/adityadasika21/NorthStar/releases/latest` on app open (background),
  compares the release tag to the installed `versionName` (dotted-number compare), and
  `ui/components/UpdatePrompt` shows an "Update available" dialog with the changelog + a
  one-tap Update → downloads the APK to `cacheDir/updates` → hands it to the system installer
  via the existing FileProvider (`<cache-path name="updates">`). Added `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`;
  routes to the unknown-sources setting if not yet granted; falls back to opening the Releases
  page if the download fails. Wired at the app root in `AppNavigation`. Only triggers when a
  release NEWER than the installed build is published.
- [ ] **CI release build (later).** GitHub Actions to build + attach the APK on tag push.
  Needs the signing key as a base64 secret — weigh against keeping the key fully offline.

## iOS — research done, spike gated (2026-09-06), council-amended

Full write-up: **[`docs/IOS_PORT_RESEARCH.md`](docs/IOS_PORT_RESEARCH.md)** · Council: **[`docs/LLM_COUNCIL_REVIEW.md`](docs/LLM_COUNCIL_REVIEW.md)**.

**Verdict:** protocol/video math is portable; product feasibility hinges on Apple platform risks (**multicast entitlement**, Local Network, screen-off, interface pinning). **Conditional Phase 0 only** — no SwiftUI until desk gates pass.

| Piece | Portable? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| K1G + RSA/AES auth + RTP/NAL | ✅ Yes | Port Swift 1:1 from `dash/protocol`, `DashAuth`, `NalProcessor`, `RtpPacketizer` |
| H.264 encode 526×300 @ 2–4 fps | ✅ Yes | `VideoToolbox` ≈ MediaCodec for this envelope |
| Dash map while screen off | ⚠️ CPU only | Do **not** use MapLibre Metal in background (GPU denied). CoreGraphics → CVPixelBuffer |
| Wi-Fi join to `RE_*` | ⚠️ UX hit | `NEHotspotConfiguration` = exact SSID + system prompt; no silent prefix join |
| Screen-off multi-hour stream | ❌ Unknown | **Must spike on a bike before any full SwiftUI port** |

**Plan (do in order):**
1. [ ] **Phase 0 spike** — join + auth + static H.264/RTP with phone locked 20–30 min (pass/fail gate)
2. [ ] Phase 1 — dash nav MVP (CPU map, OSRM, joystick, voice) only if spike passes
3. [ ] Phase 2 — Garage / fuel / rides / optional Firebase parity
4. [ ] Phase 3 — TestFlight hardening

**Decision rule:** if Phase 0 fails on Wi-Fi or background encode → keep Android-only. Do not invest in a full iOS UI before that.
CLAUDE.md remains Android-primary until the spike lands.

## Rider Score — research done (2026-09-06), council-amended

Write-up: **[`docs/RIDER_SCORE_RESEARCH.md`](docs/RIDER_SCORE_RESEARCH.md)** · Council: **[`docs/LLM_COUNCIL_REVIEW.md`](docs/LLM_COUNCIL_REVIEW.md)**

**Council ruling:** **GO on gyro+IMU logging** · **NO-GO on score UI/levels** until thresholds come from your rides. Rename as coaching/smoothness (not “safety”). Do not penalize hard-brake magnitude on a bike. Cornering via `v·ω_yaw`, not car lateral-g.

| Insight | Detail |
|---|---|
| Tesla method (historical v1 shape) | Harsh-event **rates** → risk formula → **0–100** + factor breakdown — borrow shape only |
| Our logging v0 | Phone GPS + accel **+ gyro**, tank-bag, screen-off — prove signal > vibration |
| Digital gear | Helpful later; **not** on K1G projection in fw 11.63 captures — don’t block |
| Don’t ship badges yet | No Bronze/Platinum UI until physics + thresholds are real |

**When prioritized:**
1. [ ] Instrumented ride: 50 Hz accel+gyro+GPS logs (no scoring UI)
2. [ ] Derive thresholds from those traces; fail closed if tank-bag noise dominates
3. [ ] Post-ride coaching card only after (2)
4. [ ] Gear Fitness only if `0x0C`/`0x0F` or another source provides gear/RPM

## LLM Council (2026-09-06)

Full deliberation: **[`docs/LLM_COUNCIL_REVIEW.md`](docs/LLM_COUNCIL_REVIEW.md)**.

**This month (council order):**
1. [ ] Instrumented Android screen-off ride (gyro+accel+GPS)
2. [ ] Android reliability hardening (reconnect / dash Wi-Fi settings / open P0s)
3. [ ] File Apple **Multicast Networking** entitlement request (iOS clock start)
4. [ ] Move dash basemap + router off unofficial Google tiles / OSRM-demo
5. [ ] Rider Score UI — only after log-derived thresholds
6. [ ] iOS Phase 0 desk tests — only after entitlement + doc gates; no SwiftUI yet

## Six Hats brainstorm (2026-09-06)

Skill: **`.cursor/skills/brainstorm-six-hats`** (de Bono Six Thinking Hats; people often say “seven hats”).  
Session output: **[`docs/brainstorms/2026-09-06-northstar-ios-rider-score-six-hats.md`](docs/brainstorms/2026-09-06-northstar-ios-rider-score-six-hats.md)**.

**Blue close (aligned with council):** Android instrumented ride first; iOS = entitlement + desk spike only; rider feature = post-ride smoothness coaching (not “safety”); gear deferred; no badges until thresholds exist.

## Community features (END GOAL — long horizon, after the app is solid)

The eventual vision once the core is stable: **community / social riding.** Not now — this is
the north star, not the next sprint.

- **Shared rides** — share a ride/route with another rider; ride together with shared
  destination + live presence.
- **Live location sharing** among a group on a trip (opt-in, privacy-first).
- **Shared/public routes & POIs** — curated Himalayan routes, fuel/food/viewpoint pins,
  road-condition notes contributed by riders.
- **Ride feed / history sharing** — optionally publish a completed ride (track + stats).
- Implies real backend + identity + privacy model + moderation — a significant step up from
  today's bring-your-own-Firebase, local-first design. Re-architect deliberately when we get
  there; don't pre-build for it now (keep the app lean per CLAUDE.md).

## Cross-cutting / housekeeping

- [ ] Google Sign-In OAuth: confirm the Android OAuth client (package + SHA-1
  `80:30:BD:71:…`) is registered in GCP console — `UNREGISTERED_ON_API_CONSOLE`
  was the cause of "[16] reauth failed". Console-side, defer.
- [ ] Verify screen-off streaming on the bike end-to-end (foreground service +
  locks landed; needs a real ride to confirm it holds and stays cool).
- [ ] **Capture the dash with logging** (user offered): joystick
  forwarding in nav view, time-sync cadence, telemetry decode (P1b), exact
  nav-info glyph codes. One good capture answers all four — do this next ride.

## Done

- [x] Dash control-plane protocol corrected vs better-dash (broadcast TX, offset-8
  parse, stateful RSA auth, nav-entry order). Dash connects + shows the map.
- [x] Programmatic WiFi join to `RE_P0RP_260525` (pwd `12345678`) + auto-reconnect.
- [x] Foreground service + wake/wifi locks so streaming survives screen-off.
- [x] OSM map renderer into the hardware H.264 encoder (tiles, rider dot, dest pin,
  straight-line bearing, distance banner).
- [x] Google Maps share intent → parse → RouteScreen → Send to Dash (plumbing;
  needs P1 validation).
- [x] Single-button connect flow (WiFi → auth → nav → stream).
- [x] **GPS no longer freezes when the screen goes off** — foreground service now
  declares the `location` FGS type (Android 14+ cuts location to backgrounded
  apps without it; rider position stuck at first fix).
- [x] **Frame loop survives encoder errors** — 4 fps loop catches exceptions and
  rebuilds the MediaCodec encoder after 3 consecutive failures, instead of dying
  silently while heartbeats keep the session "connected" (map frozen, nav stopped).
- [x] **Dash clock fed real time** — replaced better-dash's hardcoded capture time
  (14:51:52, sent once) with a dynamic 06 06 time-sync at connect + every 30 s.
- [x] **Smoother map (fixed "cheap"/laggy feel)** — encoder 4→8 fps (+bitrate
  204k→327k), and `DashViewModel.tick` now eases a smoothed camera toward each GPS
  fix (0.35/frame) so motion glides between 1 Hz updates instead of stepping; sig
  resolution tightened to ~1 m so each eased step redraws.
- [x] **Nicer basemap** — swapped OSM-standard tiles for CartoDB **Voyager**
  (cleaner, Google-Maps-like); cache dir bumped to `tiles_voyager` to drop the old
  style; standby bg matched to Voyager land colour.
- [x] **App icon** — Northstar compass star (`~/Downloads/Northstar.png`) wired as
  adaptive (star foreground + #080809 bg) + legacy square/round at all densities.
- [x] **Share fixed (singleTask)** — MainActivity `singleTop`→`singleTask`, so a Maps
  share routes into the one existing (connected) instance instead of a new "not
  connected" task. Default zoom 19 / max 20. "7.9 km" template default → 0.
- [x] **Share works while connected to the dash** — replaced `bindProcessToNetwork`
  (which starved the whole app of internet on the no-internet dash WiFi) with
  per-socket binding (`Network.bindSocket` on the dash UDP sockets only). Routing,
  geocoding, tile fetch now use cellular while the dash sockets use the dash WiFi.
- [x] **Off-route rerouting** — `DashViewModel.maybeReroute`: >4 s off the line →
  Router recomputes from live GPS to the destination (12 s cooldown). Enabled by the
  per-socket internet fix above.
- [x] **Map-matching** — rider snapped onto the route within 25 m (kills GPS
  lane/road jitter), raw GPS shown when genuinely off-route so reroute still fires.
- [x] **Stationary GPS drift fixed** — `requestLocationUpdates` minDistance 2 m→0, so
  GPS keeps reporting when parked and a coarse NETWORK fix can't take over and wander.
  Plus GPS-preference + impossible-jump rejection in `LocationTracker`.
- [x] **Real Google Maps tiles** on the dash (distinct buildings/roads/colours) —
  replaced washed-out Voyager; gentle saturation only (over-processing flattened it).
- [x] **Exit navigation → free roam** button on the Dash screen.
- [x] **Auto-connect** on opening the Dash screen (no manual Connect tap each ride).
- [x] **0F telemetry decrypt logging** — but live capture showed the dash actually
  streams **plaintext `0x0C`** fields; with ignition on they read ~0 (ODO/trip/fuel
  all zero vs the dash's own 324 km), so the dash does NOT forward instrument data to
  a projection client. Telemetry-into-app is therefore not feasible over this link.

## Pending (needs the phone reconnected)

- [ ] **Kill the duplicate app entries + work-profile install.** Likely an old
  `com.example.northstar` build (default id, pre-`com.northstar.app`) still on the
  device → two icons. When the phone's back: `adb uninstall com.example.northstar`,
  `adb uninstall com.northstar.app`, then reinstall to the personal user only:
  `adb install --user 0 app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.
- [ ] Consider Voyager **@2x** tiles for extra crispness on the dash — deferred:
  512 px tiles are ~4× memory, would need the LruCache (120) cut to ~40 to be safe.
